-create MakeFile that loops through all regions we want to support looks up AMIs for CentOS, Ubuntu, Amazon and then creates an AMI.tf file in each env
-add to MakeFile ability to create global vars file that is copied to each env (avoid some copy/pasta between envs) --- optionally we can sym link the files to each env??? OR use TF env function??
- look at using vault provider for secrets
-better way to handle keys per regions
-handle deploy of keys to bastion to allow priv instance access (automated)
-swap out NAT gateways in non-prod envs with plan ole NAT instances to avoid high AWS charges; use NAT GW only in prod
- bootstrap/userdata --> eventually move to using CM like ansible for this as well as pre-baked AMIs via packer

DONE:
-convetrt to templates for user-data scripts instead of files (kill off heredoc where I can)
-get secrets out of the tf files (prompt for via variables instead; can set env vars if needed)
